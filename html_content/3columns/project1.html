<h1>Web security everywhere</h1>

<p>This device was semifinalist of <a href="http://hackaday.com/2014/09/06/secure-your-internets-with-web-security-everywhere/">The Hackaday Prize contest</a></p>
<p>Basically, this device acts as a wifi / ethernet router and access point. It could connect to the internet using some random wifi, a wired network, or a tethered android phone (wifi or usb). On the secured side, it acts as a wireless access point with internet forwarding so it works with every kind of device : PC, laptop, smartphone, using Windows, GNU/Linux, Android or even Mac-OSX.</p>
<p>The wireless access-point is also hardened with a random key feature. The access-point security key could be modified on-demand and at boot-time with a random one.</p>
<p>From the touch screen interface, TOR or an OpenVPN tunnel could be enabled. This custom interface could be used for complete operation, full setup and device monitoring.</p>
<p>It only needs a wifi adapter and no setup on the endpoint device (computer, smartphoneâ€¦) to work. The user interface is also very easy to use with on/off buttons, so it is very easy to operate by non tech people.</p>
<p>In sensitive situations, the complete software and operating system could be installed in a few minutes from a preconfigured and encrypted image. The SD-card could also be removed from the device or even destroyed in a few seconds, causing no harm to the device, but makes it completely empty and useless. This way, sensitive data such as SSH private keys are secure.</p>
<p>The device hardware is open source, and uses only free software. This way, it could be improved by the community when it needs to, and it also helps defend digital freedom and Human Rights.</p>
<p>It also makes a perfect device to fight planned obscolescence : the software is built to be cross-compatible with different boards, offering different features, to adapt to various situations and evolve over time.</p>

<h2>How you can help</h2>

<p>This device is still in a prototype stage. It is actually looking for many things:</p>

<ul>
	<li>some technical and security expertise</li>
	<li>a lot of feedback (reason I don't have any comments is still a mystery)</li>
	<li>some funding would really help, I'm looking for a solution to kickstart from France but I'm open to everything</li>
	<li>Of course, you are very welcome to spread the word about this project !</li>
	<li>If you are willing to help, or just want to discuss about the project, please drop me a line !</li>
	<li>If you are interested, I also added a Paypal Donate button on this page.</li>
