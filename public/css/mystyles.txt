You won't find any css style here
because mystyles.css file is not yet generated.

Definition for mystyles.css you can find here:
https://github.com/toporny/andrea_project/blob/master/sass/mystyles.scss

You can generate this file by 'gulp' command.

More info here:
https://github.com/toporny/andrea_project/blob/master/readme.md

If you really don't want to generate by yourself you can still find CSS files on my server:

css after minification:
